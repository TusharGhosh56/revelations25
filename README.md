# Revelations25

“Revelations 2025” is an Intra-departmental Fest that
is organized by the Department of Computer Science
for the Post Graduate students every year. The objective
of this Fest is to provide a platform for the students
to show case their talents in technical as well as
non-technical events. The theme for “Revelations 2025”
is “Timeless Toons”.

The students were divided into six leagues – Ben 10, 
Chhota Bheem, Spongebob, Aladdin, Shinchan, and Mr. Bean.
In and around every event, there were about 160+ students
competing against each other. The Fest has 11 events in total.
The events are conducted from the 21st of March, spanning for a
week up until the 1st of April.
